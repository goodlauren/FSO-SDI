        <p>The theme of my project is movie night with some friends. I chose this theme because I wanted to use a normal "could happen any day" sort of scenario and show how small choice could completely change the outcome. </p>
        <p>In my project I have a group of friends making plans for hanging out later that evening and even have them joking about the number of girls that are going to be there.</p>
        <p>All in all, I found that this assignment was hard, but completely satisfying once having finished it.</p>
